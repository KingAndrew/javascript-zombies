        h1 Scope And Garbage Collection

        p
          | JavaScript is a garbage collected language. You don't
          | explicitly allocate and de-allocate memory. Instead,
          | you just assign objects and values to variables and
          | object attributes. This allocates the needed amount
          | of memory for the thing being assigned. When you're
          | done with that thing, you don't need to de-allocate
          | the memory. You only need to de-reference the 
          | variable or object attribute, and the garbage
          | collector will eventually clean it up.
