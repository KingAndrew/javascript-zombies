          | Closures are a way of providing a variable to a 
          | function, without having to pass that variable as
          | a parameter. They can be considered a form of 
          | "controlled memory leak". They allow access to a 
          | non-global variable they did not declare, and one
          | that normally would have fallen out of scope. 
          | Variables that are declared in one function and
          | accessible in another function (typically a child
          | function) without being passed in as a parameter
          | are said to be in a closure.
